    "about": "I am a Junior Fullstack JavaScript Developer with extensive working experience in European Politics. My background in political science and statistics has allowed me to develop my analytical problem-solving skills and creativity by designing and implementing my own projects. Due to my work at the NSA Inquiry Committee of the German Parliament I discovered my passion for computers, project management and coding. This life-changing experience inspired me to become a Web Developer. I seek to combine my academic achievements, my work experience in a political environment and coding experience in a challenging role as a Web Developer."
